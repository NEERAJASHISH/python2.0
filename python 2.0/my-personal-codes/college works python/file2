Problem Statement 
• The ultimate purpose of a direct brain computer interface (BCI) is to allow an individual with severe motor 
disabilities to have effective control over devices.
• Enabling the communication with computers and controls of external devices such as robotic agents.
• A small SNR and different noise sources are amongst the greatest challenges in EEG-based BCI 
application studies.
• People with ALS, spinal cord injury or brain-stem stroke represent populations for whom BCI is important 
and useful. Hence there arises a need for faster, more reliable BCI systems that work for more potential 
users.
 
Project chosen
• The main purpose of choosing this project is, Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), it allows the users to 
communicate or control external devices using brain signals rather than the brain's normal output pathways 
of peripheral nerves and muscles. 
• Motivated by the hope of restoring independence to severely disabled individuals and by interest in further 
extending human control of external systems, researchers from many fields are engaged in this challenging 
new work.

Objective
• This project attempts to implement an Arduino robot to simulate a brainwave-controlled wheelchair for 
paralyzed patients with an improved controlling method.
• The robot should be able to move freely in anywhere under the control of the user and it is not required to 
predefine any map or path.
Scope
• The process can be tracked in real time. Once connected, a user can communicate with other users online 
by using brainwaves detected via an EEG device.
• Evaluating using Machine learning algorithms and to develop an efficient BCI model.
Methodology
• These brain activities can be detected using electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. BCI transforms the 
EEG signals produced by brain activity into control signals which can be later used for controlling the 
wheelchair without using any physical controls. 
• Since the brain signals are very weak, we need to apply amplifiers and some spatial and spectral filters to 
the EEG signals in order to extract the features of these signals.
• The detected EEG signals are based on the change of frequencies and change of amplitudes. 
• Unwanted signals contained in the main signal can be termed as noise, artifacts, or interference. There are 
two sources of EEG artifacts: external or environmental source and physiological source.
• To achieve higher mobility and lower cost, instead of a laptop, a powerful single-board computer like 
raspberry pi can be used to implement and train the neural network.

Hardware And Software Used
• Neuroelectrics Instrument Controller (NIC2) – Software that allows computers to interact and control 
Neuroelectrics devices. 
• EEG kit 
• EDF Browser – A graphic viewer designed to analyze EEG
• MATLAB 2021 
• Python
• Arduino Uno, RC Car Chassis 4WD (4 Wheel Drive).
• HC05 Bluetooth module.
• L293D/L298N (Motor driver).
• Ultrasonic Sensor, IR sensor.
Applications 
• The future work will be implementing this method to a real wheelchair and take experiments with some 
paralysis patients like ALS.
• EEG-based BCIs include spelling systems, wheelchair control, robot control, mental workload, virtual 
reality, and gaming, environment control, driver fatigue monitoring, biometrics system, and emotion 
recognition.
• Brain-computer interfaces (BCI) are increasingly becoming reliable pieces of technology, changing the 
lives of patients, particularly of patients who suffer from paralysis or similar conditions.in which one of 
the scopes is A project called “Brainternet” is generating additional excitement for the field of BCI 
technology by converting the brain of a user into a node for the internet of things (IoT), which allows a 
“plugged-in” brain to connect to the internet.
• A headset of electrodes is attached, and action potentials are detected and then transmitted to a small 
receiver called a Raspberry Pi. This device acts to convert brain activity into signals uploaded to public 
domains on the internet.
