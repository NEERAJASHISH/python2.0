OPERATION MODES
The Cortex-M3 processor has two modes and two privilege levels. 
The operation modes - thread mode and handler mode- determine whether 
the processor is running a normal program or running an exception handler 
like an interrupt handler or system exception handler. 
The privilege levels (privileged level and user level) provide a mechanism 
for safeguarding memory accesses to critical regions as well as providing a 
basic security model.
Software in the privileged access level can switch the program into the user 
access level using the control register. 
When an exception takes place, the processor will always switch back to the 
privileged state and return to the previous state when exiting the exception 
handler.
A user program cannot change back to the privileged state by writing to the 
control register.
It has to go through an exception handler that programs the control register 
to switch the processor back into the privileged access level when returning to 
thread mode 
It can be used in conjunction with privilege levels to protect critical memory 
locations, such as programs and data for OS.
